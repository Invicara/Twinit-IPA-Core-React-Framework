# Twinit IPA Core React Framework (ipa-core)

This repository contains open-source code for the ipa-core React framework for use in rapidly developing React web clients for Twinit.

The ipa-core framework offers automatically routing your users through Twinit's authentication, managing your user's tokens, and displaying a dialog for your user to select the project and user group they wish to use.

It also provides an extensible user interface framework with configurable header and nav bars, which can also be hidden if you do not wish to use them.

Generic and configurable pages such as dashboards, entty views, and file upload as well as configurable controls are also included in the ipa-core library.
